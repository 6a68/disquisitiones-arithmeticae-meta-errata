# disquisitiones-arithmeticae-meta-errata

Gauss's DA is available in the [original Latin](https://archive.org/details/werkecarlf01gausrich), as well as in two English editions: a notoriously buggy softcover translation, $50, and a corrected edition of that translation, marked up to $200 by the villains at Springer.

The publisher of the cheaper edition doesn't maintain an errata sheet, so I am maintaining here a list of errata published on the web.

If you know of additional errata, feel free to email me (ohai@6a68.net) or submit a pull request adding a link to this document.

## Errata links


- A review by Gordon Pall in the 1967 Canadian Math. Bull. states pointedly that the sense of many of Gauss's sentences is lost due to the generally poor translation. (Available via [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=_t844-IR1V8C&lpg=PA327&ots=PBqQB68bjT&dq=gauss%20clarke%20translation%20errata&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q&f=false))
  - The review contains errata for articles 1, 5, 7, 16, 17, 22, 32, 36, 38, 42, 46.
  - The reviewer also suggests that articles 8, 39, 61 need revision, but doesn't give corrections.
- Art. 1-40: Differences between the two editions are collected in [this mathoverflow answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/912933/gauss-disq-arithm-translation-errata) (I'm happy to give credit but there's no real name connected with that account)
