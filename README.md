# disquisitiones-arithmeticae-meta-errata

## Background 

Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is available in the [original Latin](https://archive.org/details/werkecarlf01gausrich), as well as in two English editions: a notoriously poor softcover translation, $50, and a corrected edition of that translation, marked up to $200 by the villains at Springer.

The publisher of the cheaper edition doesn't maintain an errata sheet, so I am maintaining here a list of errata published on the web (a list of lists, hence the repo's title).

### Contributing

### How to use this document

Each corrected article number is listed individually; search the page for a given article number to find any known corrections for it.

## Errata

- A review by Gordon Pall in the 1967 Canadian Math. Bull. states pointedly that the sense of many of Gauss's sentences is lost due to the generally poor translation. (Available via [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=_t844-IR1V8C&lpg=PA327&ots=PBqQB68bjT&dq=gauss%20clarke%20translation%20errata&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q&f=false))
  - The review contains errata for articles **1, 5, 7, 16, 17, 22, 32, 36, 38, 42, 46**.
  - The reviewer also suggests that articles **8, 39, 61** need revision, but doesn't give corrections.

- Differences between the first two sections of the two translations are collected in [this mathoverflow answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/912933/gauss-disq-arithm-translation-errata)
  - Errata are given for articles **6, 9, 13, 14, 17, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40**.

- An [Amazon reviewer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R7D0QJB7BY89/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0387962549) mentions that many superscripts were rendered incorrectly in articles **200, 201**.
